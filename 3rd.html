        <p>I'm Kurt Simon Guillermo, 19 years old, and I live in Limay, Bataan. I consider myself an ambitious and curious individual with a passion for personal growth and helping others. I believe that every challenge is an opportunity to learn, and I am always ready to take on new experiences. My strengths include my strong work ethic, creativity, and adaptability, which help me handle different situations with confidence. On the flip side, I tend to overthink and can be hard on myself when things don’t go as planned. Despite this, I’m dedicated to improving myself and pushing through obstacles. I’m constantly striving to become the best version of myself, whether in my personal or professional life.
